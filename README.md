# CO2 emission of machine learning computation
CO2 emissions of machine learning computation are becoming a more and more important factor of environmental pollution, 
which needs to be faced in the next years. 
Since the number of processed data is rising exponentially, there is currently no end in sight.
Companies therefore need to become aware of how CO2 emissions caused by 
machine learning can be contained and reduced. As a first step, 
it is necessary to be able to determine and predict the CO2 emis-sions caused by machine learning.
In this project, I have addressed this issue and developed an approach to determine the amount of CO2emission.
